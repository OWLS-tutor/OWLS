<h1> What I Offer </h1>

<img src="OWLS.jpeg" alt="OWLS" width="50%" align="right" />

<p> Private UCT graduated English and Afrikaans tutor. Panorama primary school is within walking distance from where I live. </p>

<h1> About My Lessons </h1>

<p> My goal is to involve the students in the class as much as possible and encourage their active participation. The teacher should always involve the students by continuously 
asking them questions. I believe that each lesson should be tailored to each student's needs and focused on helping them achieve their goals. </p>

<h1> About Me </h1>

<p> My name is Werner and I live in Cape Town, South Africa. I have adored everything about the use of language for as long as I can remember. Because of my love for language,
 I majored in English and Afrikaans at the University of Cape Town. I also did my honors in library science because of my love for books. After university, I decided to share
 my love for language with new students. Consequently, I got a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) level 5 advanced diploma. 
Teaching is my passion and I hope to see you soon, as my new students soon. </p>
